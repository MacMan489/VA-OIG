An example of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) code along with its description and business value:

ETL Code:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Extract data from the source system
source_data = pd.read_csv('source_data.csv')

# Transform data
transformed_data = source_data[['customer_id', 'order_date', 'total_amount']]

# Load data into the destination system
transformed_data.to_csv('destination_data.csv', index=False)
Description:
This ETL code is written in Python and demonstrates a simplified data extraction, transformation, and loading process. 
It assumes the existence of a source data file in CSV format ('source_data.csv'). The code uses the pandas library to read the CSV file,
extract specific columns ('customer_id', 'order_date', 'total_amount'), perform any necessary data transformations 
(e.g., filtering, column renaming, data type conversions), and store the transformed data in a new CSV file ('destination_data.csv').

Business Value:
ETL processes are essential for businesses to gather, transform, and load data from various sources into a target destination, 
such as a data warehouse or a reporting database. This example code showcases a basic ETL operation for processing sales data.
By extracting relevant columns from the source data, businesses can focus on specific information of interest 
(e.g., customer ID, order date, total amount) and disregard unnecessary data. The transformation step allows businesses 
to manipulate the data as required (e.g., aggregations, filtering) to derive meaningful insights or prepare it for downstream analysis. 
Finally, the loading phase stores the transformed data in a format suitable for further analysis, reporting, or integration with other systems. 
This ETL code provides a foundation for automating data processing tasks, improving data quality, and enabling more informed 
decision-making processes.
